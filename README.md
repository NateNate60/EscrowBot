# EscrowBot

Dependencies:

- Bit (`pip3 install bit`). Bitcoin library.
- Bitcash (`pip3 install bitcash`). Bitcoin Cash library.
- Bitcoinlib (`pip3 install bitcoinlib`). Used for its Litecoin functionality and fee estimation. The Bitcoin functionality is not actually used
- Web3 (`pip3 install web3`). Ethereum library
- Hashlib. IDs are generated using SHA-1 hashes. SHA-1 is faster than SHA-2 and these don't need to be resistent to attacks because they're only used for ID purposes

**PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PERUSE MY CODE AND POINT OUT MISTAKES, BUGS, OR SECURITY FLAWS**

If you spot a security flaw, either open an issue to bring it to my attention or fix it yourself and open a pull request.

Also, if you're wondering why I only use `bitcoinlib` for Litecoin and not for Bitcoin as well, it's because `bitcoinlib` is stupidly slow to run. `bit` is much faster than `bitcoinlib`, no contest.

## Donations welcome!

If I get enough in donations then we probably won't need to collect any escrow fees. I'm not doing this for profit.
